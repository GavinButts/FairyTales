Sojourning through a southern realm in youth,

I came upon a house by happy chance

Where bode a marvellous Beauty. There, romance

She lay not blanketed in drowsy trance,

But leapt alert of limb and keen of glance,

From sun to shower; from gaiety to ruth;

Because it was too soon, and not my part,

To start voluptuous pulses in her heart,

And kiss her to the world of Consciousness.
